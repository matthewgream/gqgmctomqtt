Currently implemented for a GQ Electronics GMC-500+ over serial USB (defaults to /dev/ttyUSB0) to:
(1) read, at serial configuration time, device model (hardware and firmware) and serial number.
    also read device config cpm/Svh calibration values.
(2) loop indefinitely to read/report CPM with specified periodicity (defaults to 30 seconds):
  (2a) calculate CPM average (rolling period 1 hour) and uSvH (based on calibration values).
  (2b) report CPM to stdout.
  (2c) report CPM to MQTT, if configured (default broker mqtt://localhost and topic sensors/radiation).
  (2d) report CPM to GMCMAP, if configured (using specified user_id and counter_id).
  (2e) if serial disconnection or fault, wait and poll until serial is reconnected, then resume (step 1)
The communication specification from GC Electronics is at https://www.gqelectronicsllc.com/download/GQ-RFC1801.txt
(to support GQ-RFC1201.txt based devices, a couple of modifications are needed as stated in the .c source)
Note the hearbeat mode is not used as it reports CPS that needs translation to CPM.
Implemented in JavaScript (for NodeJS) and C. AI assisted development.
Also provided a systemctl file.
