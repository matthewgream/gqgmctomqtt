Currently implemented for a GQ Electronics GMC-500+ over serial USB (defaults to /dev/ttyUSB0) to:
(1) read, at serial configuration time, device model (hardware and firmware) and serial number.
(2) loop indefinitely to read/report CPM with specified periodicity (defaults to 30 seconds):
  (2a) report CPM to stdout.
  (2b) report CPM to MQTT (default broker mqtt://localhost and topic sensors/radiation/cpm).
  (2c) if serial disconnection or fault, wait and poll until serial is reconnected, then resume (step 1)
The communication specification from GC Electronics is at https://www.gqelectronicsllc.com/download/GQ-RFC1201.txt.
Note the hearbeat mode is not used as it reports CPS that needs translation to CPM.
Implemented in JavaScript (for NodeJS) and C. AI assisted development.
Also provided a systemctl file.
